Notes From Todd 4/4
    Papers
        - Searching for the next best mate: Peter Todd
        - Should I stay or should I go: ANgela Wu? & Peter Dan
        - Don't stop till you get enough: Guerickis & Maloney
        - The value of approaching best things: Rich & Gureckis
    Game Parameters
        - Number of cards 
        - Distribution of values
        - Range of values
        - Sampling with/out replacement
        - Search cost
    Overall Ideas
        - Transfer learning: Choose a subset of games, train agents on the training games and evaluate on unseen games
        - Apply search cost for better human comparison
        - "How far off are we if we stop at X%"
        - Are there flat maximas?
    Agents
        - Q-learning
            - Actual values
            - Greater than, less than, equal to mean/median
            - Hashed values
        - SARSA
        - Deep Q-learning
